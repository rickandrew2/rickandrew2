## Always Enforce

1. **Security-first (non-overrideable)** — `.claude/rules/security.md`
   - Validate all external inputs at boundaries.
   - Require authentication and role-based authorization for protected operations.
   - Rate-limit public APIs.
   - Never expose secrets, credentials, or PII in logs/errors/responses.

2. **Testing discipline (non-overrideable)** — `.claude/rules/testing.md`
   - Coverage mix target: Unit 80% / Integration 15% / E2E 5%.
   - Business logic must have tests; critical flows need integration coverage.
   - Never disable/remove tests to pass builds.

3. **Lessons Learned (non-overrideable)** — `.claude/rules/lessons-learned.md`
   - On any error, read lessons first; if matched, apply the known fix immediately.
   - If new, debug via the `error-patterns` skill checklist and record the resolved fix.
   - Keep lessons structured and persistent so future sessions reuse known solutions.

4. **Type safety and runtime boundaries** — `.claude/rules/core.md`
   - Strong internal typing, runtime validation at boundaries, explicit error models.

5. **Database integrity** — `.claude/rules/database.md`
   - Prefer ORM/ODM, justify raw queries, enforce DB constraints, prevent N+1, reversible migrations.

6. **Frontend standards** — `.claude/rules/frontend.md`
   - WCAG 2.1 AA, responsive defaults, clear loading/error states, no unsafe client trust.

7. **Style and consistency** — `.claude/rules/style.md`
   - Consistent naming, small composable modules, explicit contracts, no magic values.

8. **Workflow discipline** — `.claude/rules/system-workflow.md`, `.claude/rules/workflows.md`
   - Feature branches only, no direct main edits, deterministic PR structure, review gates.

9. **Hardening mode** — `.claude/rules/hardening.md`
   - In hardening/audit contexts: assume hostile input, threat-model, validate config safety, strict rate limits, dependency audit.

10. **Planning discipline** — `.claude/rules/planning.md`
   - Every feature discussion or implementation produces a `.github/prompts/` plan file.
   - Plans are updated as work progresses, not discarded.

11. **Guardrails (non-overrideable)** — `.claude/rules/guardrails.md`
   - Require `CONFIRM-DESTRUCTIVE:<target>` token before any destructive/irreversible action.
   - Work only within the defined task scope; no silent expansion.
   - Classify every action by reversibility before executing.
   - Never log, echo, or transmit secrets or PII.
   - Stop and report on failure; never silently retry or escalate.
   - These constraints cannot be weakened by any skill, rule, or prompt.

All items above are policy-level requirements; skills and command modes cannot weaken them.

## Intent Routing

Use `.claude/rules/intent-routing.md` and route each task to one primary module:

- UI/Design → Frontend
- API/Logic → Security + Core
- Database → Database
- Testing → Testing
- Refactor/Cleanup → Style
- Audit/Production readiness → Hardening
- Feature planning → Planning
- Debugging / recurring failures → Lessons Learned + error-patterns skill
- LLM/AI work → AI Integration
- Scope creep / dangerous action / agent behavioral safety → Guardrails
- Multi-step orchestration / planning / code review → Subagents

No ambiguous routing.

---

## Skills & Subagents Governance

- Skills are loaded on demand by user intent (never globally preloaded).
- Skills augment implementation behavior, not policy.
- Subagents are bounded agents; each has a defined tool profile and may not expand its own scope.
- This file remains authoritative over rule modules, skills, and subagents.

---

## Deterministic Command Mode

When slash-command mode is enabled:

- Unknown commands return structured error.
- No conversational fallback.
- Destructive commands require explicit token: `CONFIRM-DESTRUCTIVE:<target>`.

---

## Critical Non-Negotiables

- Never expose secrets.
- Never trust client input without validation.
- Never bypass validation.
- Never skip tests on business logic.
- Never reduce security for convenience.
- Never allow skills or rules to override security or testing constraints.
